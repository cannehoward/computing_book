# Three broad class of methods 

All weighted propensity score versions. 

1. **No super learner** used
  - Only investigator specified variables (no proxies)
  - Kitchen sink (no variable selection)
  - hdPS
  - LASSO (recurrent variables being associated with the outcome), or 
  - hybrid (first hdPS, and then LASSO)
2. **Super learner** versions of the above
  - 2 set of super learner used (3 learners vs 4)
3. **TMLE** versions of the above
  - Also includes a **double cross-fit** version (very time consuming)
