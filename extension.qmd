# Univariate selection of many proxies

-   Recurrent covariates selected separately / <mark>univariately</mark>
-   can be correlated (coming from same patient) and cause <mark>multicollinearity</mark>
-   may <mark>inflate variance</mark>
-   General <mark>overfitting</mark> problem. Too many adjustment variables?

## Potential ways to improve

- Multiple recurrent covariates could provide same information, may not be useful anymore in the presence of others. <mark>Multivariate structure</mark> could be good to consider in a single model.
- Machine learning <mark>variable selection methods</mark> could be useful to combat multicollinearity.
- <mark>Sample splitting</mark> methods could be useful in combating overfitting in high dimensions.
