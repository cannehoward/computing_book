## Step 1: Propensity score estimation

```{mermaid}

The type of variables we want to include in the propensity score modelling: this should be based on prior knowledge. Usually empirical selection of variables is discouraged. Understanding the **role of each variable**, e.g., effect modifier vs. confounder will determine the analysis strategy.

  A1110[\Variable roles\] --> A1111{{Select variables <br/>causing outcome}}
  A1110 --> A1112{{select variables <br/>causing both outcome <br/>and exposure}}

  style A1110 fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

## Step 2: Propensity score matching

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
subgraph ZA[" "]
direction LR
  B[(Propensity <br/>score <br/>Matching)] --> B1(Matching<br/> methods)
  B --> B2(Matching <br/>ratios)

## Step 3: Balance of Propensity score matched dataset

```{mermaid}

  C --> C2(Variance  <br/>ratio)

  C2 --> C11
  C3 --> C11
  C3 --> C31[\Propensity scores <br/>too close <br/>to 0 or 1\]
end

subgraph ZAAA[" "]
direction RL
  C11 --> C111[/Go back to <br/>Exposure modelling step\]
  C31 --> C111
  C31 --> C112[/Trimming, <br/>not preferred\]
end

ZA -.-> ZAA -.-> ZAAA
```

## Step 4: treatment effect estimation from outcome model

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
subgraph ZA[" "]
direction LR
  D[(Outcome <br/>modelling)] --> D1(Crude)
  D --> D2(Adjusted)
  D --> D4(Variance <br/>estimation)
end

subgraph ZAA[" "]
direction LR
  D2 --> D221[All covariates, <br/>preferred]
  D2 --> D222[Partial list <br/>of covariates]
  D4 --> D41[Cluster options]
  D4 --> D42[Bootstrap options]
end

ZA -.-> ZAA
```

## Reporting

-   We should report the results and interpret the treatment effect estimates in the context of the research question and the underlying assumptions.
-   We need to clearly communicate the limitations and potential biases in the analysis, and reporting of results from useful **sensitivity analyses**.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
subgraph ZA[" "]
direction LR
  D6(Sensitivity <br/>Analysis <br/>for <br/>overall process) --> D5(Sensitivity <br/>Analysis <br/>for unmeasured <br/>confounding)
end

subgraph ZAA[" "]
direction LR
  D5 --> D51[Rosenbaum <br/>bounds]
  D5 --> D52[Quantitative <br/>bias analysis, <br/>E-value]
  D6 --> D62[Alternative <br/>matching <br/>algorithm]
  D6 --> D61[Alternative <br/>model <br/>specifications]
  D6 --> D63[Alternative <br/>missing data <br/>method]
end

ZA -.-> ZAA
```

-   We should also discuss the implications of the findings for the target population and the broader scientific literature.

## Total cholesterol level example

A predictive goal, on the other hand, would involve developing a model that can accurately predict total cholesterol levels based on various factors, including Rosuvastatin use and other relevant predictors (e.g., race, sex, and age).
:::

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Rosuvastatin] --> Y(Total cholesterol level)
  B[Race] --> Y
  C[Sex] --> Y
  D[Age] --> Y
```

## Causal goal

The causal goal focuses on understanding the causal relationship between a risk factor (often a treatment, A) and a health outcome (Y). It aims to identify the factors that contribute to the development, progression, or prevention of a specific disease or health outcome. Control for confounding factors (L) is often a necessary step in understanding such a relationship, as these factors may obscure the true causal relationship between the treatment and the outcome. The focus of this goal is often on estimating the parameter **'treatment effect'**, which represents the **causal effect** of the treatment (A) on the outcome (Y). Causal goals guide the development of effective interventions and policies by understanding the mechanism by which the factors influence health outcomes.

## Total cholesterol level example

Causal goal helps understanding the causal effect of Rosuvastatin on total cholesterol levels while accounting for confounding factors such as race, sex, and age.
:::

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Rosuvastatin] --> Y(Total cholesterol level)
  B[Race] --> Y
  C[Sex] --> Y
  D[Age] --> Y
  B --> A
  C --> A
  D --> A
```

::: callout-important
There can be a **overlaps** between causal and predictive goals in epidemiological research, but they serve distinct purposes and have different focuses.

-   Understanding the causal relationships between variables can help improve the accuracy of predictive models. For example, if you know that a certain factor causally affects a health outcome, incorporating that factor into the prediction model can lead to better predictions.
-   The process of building a predictive model may shed light on potential causal relationships between variables that could be further investigated in causal analyses.
